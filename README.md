# ‚úíÔ∏è Vacancies Collector

An application with a FastAPI backend and a user-friendly Telegram bot client.
---

## üöÄ About The Project

This project is a tool for parsing job vacancies from two platforms (hh.ru and kwork.ru) and features a scheduling system to send notifications about the results. It consists of five key parts:

*   **REST API on FastAPI:** A backend that handles processing, storage, and delivery of vacancy data, and provides the ability to save parsed jobs.
*   **Telegram Bot on aiogram 3:** An interactive client that allows users to add, modify, view, and delete keywords for which they want to receive relevant job openings.
*   **Scheduler:** A scheduler that, at set intervals, triggers notifications about new vacancies on the job platforms and determines which vacancies to send to which users.
*   **Scripts (Scrapers):** Scrapers responsible for collecting data from the job platforms.
*   **Services (Notification Sender):** A service that automatically sends a message to the user containing details about a new vacancy.

This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to backend development: from data collection and storage to API creation, process automation, and user interaction.
